		<h1>SN15 Lands!</h1>
			<h4>Wednesday, May 5, 2021</h4>
			<p>On Wednesday, May 5, SpaceX's Starship SN15 successfully lifted off from suborbital pad A from the Starbase launch site in south Texas. SN15 is the first full scale starship prototype outfitted with a nose cone and multiple raptors to successfully perform a soft landing. As some of you may know, Starship SN10 did land after its flight, however due to a hard landing, it exploded a few minutes after touching down. At this point, Starship is standing verticle on the landing pad waiting for teams to move in and secure the vehicle. However, it is unclear what SN15's fate is from this point on. The most likely scenario would be for SpaceX to disassemble SN15 to learn about how the vehicle performed and what condition it is in after flight. Other possible scenarios include an inspection of the exterior of the vehicle, and it is simply retired, or teams could put SN15 back on the pad for a reflight. Check back here for updates on SN15's future as well as when we could see SN16 fly.</p>
