		<h1>SpaceX Launches GPS III-05 Mission</h1>
			<h4>Sunday, June 20, 2021</h4>
			<p>SpaceX successfully launched the GPS III-05 mission for the United States Space Force on Thursday, June 17, 2021 at 12:09 PM EST from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. GPS III-5 is the fifth out of ten Gen3 satellites needed to replace the existing Gen2 satellites making up the current GPS system. SpaceX successfully launched previous GPS III satellites, however this mission was unique. Falcon 9 booster <a href="../vehicles/B1062/1062.html">B1062</a> supported this mission, which, for those of you keeping track, this was the booster's second flight. This was the first launch where the United States military has allowed SpaceX to launch a mission on a reused Falcon 9 booster. The US military was the last remaining major customer to require brand new Falcon 9 boosters for each mission. Even NASA has allowed their payloads to be flown on reused boosters, most notably being the Commecial Crew astronauts being flown on reused Falcon 9 boosters as well as Crew Dragon capsules.</p>

			<h4>Sunday, May 2, 2021</h4>
			<p>Astronauts Mike Hopkins, Victor Glover, Shannon Walker, and Soichi Noguchi returned to Earth last night after a 6 month stay on board the International Space Station. Crew Dragon Resilience undocked from the station at about 8:37 PM EST on Saturday night. After several departure burns from the station, dragon moved to perform its 16 minute long deorbit burn. Following that, around 2:45 AM EST on Sunday morning, dragon re-entered the Earth's atmosphere. Just under 15 minutes later, Resilience splashed down off the coast of Panama City, Florida.</p>
			<p>This mission made history is many ways. Crew 1 was the first operational mission of Crew Dragon as part of the commercial crew program. It also featured the first international partner on board a private spacecraft from Soichi Noguchi of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). Finally, this was also the longest mission in United States space program history at 168 days.</p>
